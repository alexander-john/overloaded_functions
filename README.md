# Overloaded Functions
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the concept of overloaded functions. Two different functions can have the same name if their parameters are different; 
either because they have a different number of parameters, or because any of their parameters are of different type. 
The compiler knows which one to call in each case by examining the types passed as arguments when the function is called. 
Note that a function cannot be overloaded only by its return type. At least one of its parameters must have a different type. :face_with_spiral_eyes:
